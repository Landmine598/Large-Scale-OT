# Large-Scale-OT

Implementation in PyTorch of stochastic algorithms for the computation of Regularized Optimal Transport proposed in [1]

[1] Proposes:
 - A stochastic algorithm (Alg. 1) for computing the optimal dual variables of the regularized OT problem (from which the regularized-OT objective can be computed simply)
 - A stochastic algorithm (Alg. 2) for learning an Optimal Map, parameterized as a Deep Neural Network between the source and target probability measures
 
 Both entropy and L2 regularizations are considered and implemented.
